//Notes-->

//if-then-->basic of all control-flow statements. tells the program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true

//conditional logic-->checks a condition and execute the code based on weather the condition is true or false

//OUTPUT-->
//if executed! is not an alien
//let's kill those mother-fuckers!
