//NOTES-->

//variabls--> ways to store info in system. can be accessed by the name given by developer. stored in RAM.

//as the name suggests, it can be changed i.e it's contents are variable.

//we have to declare what type of info we want to store in that variable and give it a name

//to define a variable we have to specify the data type, give a name to it, optionally add am expression to initialize the variable with a value

//expression-->this is a construct to evaluate the single value

//operators-->perporm an operation on a variable. e.g--> +,-,*,/

//here data-type---> int

//here variable--->myFirstNum

//here value--->10

//Output-->
//Here the int value is:10
//The sum is:40
